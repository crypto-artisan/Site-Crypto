## Substrate Developer Hub

The [Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/) is one of the first places every Substrate developer should visit. On it you'll find tutorials, a [Knowledge Base](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/) and the most recent [API reference](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/).

## Substrate Knowledge Base

The Substrate [Knowledge Base](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/) guides you through the different aspects of Substrate-based Blockchain development. Reading though it you'll learn how Substrate-powered Blockchains work, how you can write your own "Pallets" \(think plugins / modules\) and how you can bring Smart Contract functionality to your chain.
